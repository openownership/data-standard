_[This ticket proposes a particular approach to implementing a feature in BODS. In most cases, a proposal should be made only after the problem it tries to solve is described in a 'feature' ticket._

_See [Feature development in BODS](https://openownership.github.io/bods-dev-handbook/feature_development.html) in the Handbook._

_The title of this GitHub ticket should be 'Implementation proposal: XXXXX no.Y' where XXXXX is the feature name in the linked ticket. The proposal number, Y, should be incremented if this is an alternative proposal for meeting the needs of a feature. Comments on this ticket can be used to question, refine and develop this implementation proposal. Interactions and work on this ticket represent a collaborative process. Proposals may be paused, withdrawn, or developed into draft implementation plans. Update the 'Proposal status' as thinking progresses on this thread. Highlight changes or updates to the proposal within thread comments, with a clear 'Updated proposal' heading.]_

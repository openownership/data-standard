This Primer sets out to explain the basics of Beneficial Ownership and
the basics of a data standard handling Beneficial Ownership.

People new to the concept of Beneficial Ownership will want to know
`what it is <whatisbo>`__ and `why it's important <whyisbo>`__. Looking
then at `what data is needed <whatisbodata>`__ to describe a Beneficial
Ownership chain, we can `understand the Beneficial Ownership Data
Standard <whatisthebods>`__ as a kind of template. Finally we look at
the `scope of the Standard <whatdoesbodscover>`__ and what it offers.

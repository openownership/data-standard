Governance 
==========

BODS is developed by `Open Ownership <https://www.openownership.org/>`__, a non-profit organisation focused on beneficial ownership transparency, in partnership with `Open Data Services <https://opendataservices.coop/>`__.

An open `data standard working group <https://standard.openownership.org/en/latest/about/governance.html>`__ of data experts, beneficial ownership specialists and other interested parties also provide advice and help guide the development of BODS.

The working group is co-chaired by Open Ownership and Open Data Services - and anyone can apply to join the group by `filling out this form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRSmSUxyyv2t1k3vWXZ_3EhTW_f603MeGxgyjKnbNNE9vvbQ/viewform>`__. Virtual group meetings are held quarterly and communication is coordinated through a `Google group <https://groups.google.com/a/openownership.org/g/data-standard-wg>`__.

Data Standard Working Group - Terms of Reference
------------------------------------------------

The data standard working group helps drive the development of BODS, an open data standard designed to reduce the technical barriers to the collection and re-use of beneficial ownership data.

This working group is open to all and includes stakeholders from a range of backgrounds with an interest and expertise in data relating to corporate control or beneficial ownership, and to the use of such data in the public interest. 

While the development of the standard will take place through an open process, to which anyone can contribute, working group members take on a responsibility for guiding development of BODS, and ensuring that relevant requirements, user needs and technical considerations are taken into account.

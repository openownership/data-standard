Collecting, storing, and making beneficial ownership information available as `structured and interoperable data <https://www.openownership.org/en/principles/structured-data/>`__ improves its functionality. It reduces the cost of producing, using, and maintaining the information, and has a greater chance of meeting beneficial ownership transparency policy goals such as exposing transnational networks of illicit financial flows or supporting effective and timely due diligence.

BODS enables beneficial ownership transparency by providing a conceptual and practical framework for collecting and publishing beneficial ownership data, resulting in data that is interoperable and high quality.

BODS is developed by `Open Ownership <https://www.openownership.org/>`__, a non-profit organisation focused on beneficial ownership transparency, in partnership with `Open Data Services <https://opendataservices.coop/>`__.

An open :any:`data standard working group <working-group>` of data experts, beneficial ownership specialists and other interested parties also provides advice and helps guide the development of BODS.

   </h2>

This is v0.4 of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard. Changes are documented in the :ref:`changelog <changelog>`, and the documentation of previous versions is maintained in archive form.

Implementers should be aware that future changes are anticipated before a version 1.0 release. However, from the v0.1 release onwards, any structural changes or major definitional changes will only take place following consultation.

The `schema <https://standard.openownership.org/en/latest/schema/index.html>`__ contains a structure, fields and codelists. Where possible, validation constraints are included within the JSON schema. Constraints that cannot be integrated into the schema can be checked using the Data Review Tool. See :ref:`Conformance and validation <conformance>` for more information.

The initial development of BODS was funded by Open Ownership as part of a `UK Department for International Development (DfID) <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development>`__ funded project and its development continues to be funded by the `UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-development-office>`__ and the `Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) <https://www.norad.no/en/front/>`__.

`Open Ownership <https://www.openownership.org/en/>`__ is a non-profit organisation driving the global shift towards transparency and accountability in corporate ownership and control. Itâ€™s managed by an executive team who are overseen by a Steering Group made up of leading transparency and accountability organisations.

In order to focus on its mission, Open Ownership is fiscally sponsored by `Global Impact <https://charity.org>`__. `Fiscal sponsorship <https://charity.org/fiscal-sponsorship>`__ is a common mechanism in the non-profit sector that enables organisations to launch new programmes without needing to complete the full process of establishing a new legal entity.

The specification and documentation of BODS have been developed by Open Ownership, Open Data Services and `OpenCorporates <https://opencorporates.com/>`__. Read the
:doc:`credits <credits>` for full details of the people who have helped develop BODS.

This website contains the draft specification of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (version 0.2) plus support for its use. The Standard provides a structured template for describing beneficial ownership as machine-readable data.

    <h2>
        Background
    </h2>

Money laundering, tax evasion and obscure chains of ownership are transnational problems that require a transnational solution. Civil society, government and business can all benefit from greater transparency around :ref:`beneficial ownership <what-is-bo>`.

The Beneficial Ownership Data Standard enables this transparency by providing a solid conceptual and practical framework for collecting and publishing beneficial ownership data, resulting in data that is interoperable, more easily reused, and of higher quality.

The Standard is being developed under the guidance of a :doc:`working group <governance>` co-chaired by OpenOwnership. More details about the organisation are available at www.openownership.org.

       :alt: Timeline of standard development. 2018, Q4: release of BODS v0.1. 2019, Q2: release of BODS v0.2, Q4: release of BODS v0.3. 2020, Q1: release of BODS v1.0.

This is v0.2 of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard. The data model
has been updated and additional codelist information added since v0.1.

Implementers should be aware that future changes are anticipated, before
a version 1.0 release. However, from the v0.1 release onwards, any
structural changes or major definitional changes only take place
following consultation. A clear :ref:`changelog <changelog>` is provided,
and the documentation of previous versions is maintained in archive
form.

The schema contains a structure, fields and codelists but does not yet
enforce validation constraints on most fields.

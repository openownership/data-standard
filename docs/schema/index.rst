Data Schema
===========

.. _data-standard-index:

.. include:: warningbox.rst

BODS provides a common data model for encapsulating information about the :doc:`beneficial ownership <../primer/index>` of corporate entities and related arrangements, to facilitate :any:`sharing of information <whatisbods>`. In particular, the :any:`data model <key-concepts>` captures direct and indirect relationships of ownership and control by entities (such as companies) by other entities (including trusts and joint shareholdings) or by natural persons. 

The data model, as specified here in the Data Schema, is intended to represent, or help identify, ultimate beneficial ownership: the natural person(s) who ultimately benefit from, or control, an entity. 

The :doc:`schema browser <schema-browser>` provides a way of digging through the schema's structure, showing how its components and fields fit together. Alternatively, the :doc:`schema reference <reference>` presents these elements and their descriptions in easy-to-reference tables. 

Further considerations regarding the validation, publishing, and lifecycle of data are included in `technical guidance <guidance>`_.

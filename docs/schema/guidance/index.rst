    This is v0.2 of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard. It includes updates to the data model and additional codelist information. Implementers should be aware that future changes are anticipated, before a version 1.0 release. See the :any:`Changelog <changelog>` and `About <../../about>`_ pages for more information.

    **MUST** and **SHOULD** are used in the schema to denote required and recommended elements of the Standard, as defined in `RFC2119 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119>`_.

This section contains guidance and instruction on preparing and using BODS data. Along with the :ref:`Schema reference <schema-reference>` it comprises the core of the data schema specification.

Data Standard
=============

.. include:: warningbox.rst

BODS data encapsulates information about the :doc:`beneficial ownership <../primer/index>` of corporate vehicles, to facilitate sharing of information. The data model is based on :any:`key concepts <key-concepts>` relating to this information and its management. 

The BODS schema, defined using `JSON Schema 2020-12 <https://json-schema.org/>`_, describes the data model. The :ref:`Schema browser <schema-browser>` shows how the schema's objects and properties fit together. The :ref:`Schema reference <schema-reference>` includes an A-Z of objects, detailing their properties and related codelists. 

Further requirements are described in the :ref:`Modelling requirements <modelling-requirements>` and :ref:`System requirements <system-requirements>` sections.

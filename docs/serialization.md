Serialization
=============

The beta specification does not contain detailed information on serialization. 

However, the specification, defined by a JSON Schema, is designed to support:

* Nested JSON documents; 
* Individual statements expressed using JSON lines;
* XML representation
* Flattened representations in CSV or Excel;
* JSON-LD; 

See the [initial conceptual model document for more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nvxqKLVkWHOpu1bbr3s7E_ZCO416MrjjIMzivYjPgQ/edit#heading=h.4b74mxz3j34d).

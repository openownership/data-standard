"Each statement SHOULD contain information on its source, and whether or not "
"the information it contains has been verified. (For example, a statement may"
" be taken from official records, or self declaration, and it may or may not "
"have been checked through some process to verify that the information "
"provided is accurate.)"

"The ``annotations`` property of each statement MAY be used to provide "
"additional contextual information at the level of a whole statement, a sub-"
"object, or an individual property. For example an annotation might be used "
"to include structured information detailing the nature of the interest held "
"by a natural person in a company. In some cases, systems processing BODS "
"data may make changes to clean, enhance or otherwise update the data, such "
"as reconciling company names against identifiers. In this case, details of "
"these changes SHOULD be recorded as annotations, to allow users to clearly "
"understand the provenance of information."

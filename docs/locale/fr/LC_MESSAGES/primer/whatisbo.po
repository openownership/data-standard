"If a person owns something, they usually have some control over it. Owning "
"shares in a company may confer voting rights, for example. But ownership and"
" control are sometimes separated - by share classes, contracts, agreements "
"and other mechanisms. For example, an executive director might have the "
"right to appoint 60% of the other board members, while having little "
"financial stake in the business."

"There are a variety of cases related to onboarding, by which we mean the "

"entity (e.g. government, bank, multinational corporation, etc) to risk (e.g."

"Information of ownership and control is typically collected by onboarding "
"entities who then assess the validity of information provided by cross "
"checking with supplementary data available in open sources. In high value / "

"whether the company is connected with Politically Exposed Persons or has "
"earned negative media), and for confidence that there are no red flags they "
"are missing (e.g. that a Beneficial Owner is connected with a company on a "
"sanctions list). Following an assessment of risks, an informed judgement "
"call typically determines whether new partnerships or transactions meet the "
"policy requirements of the business."

"``statementDate`` is the date that the information about the entity, person "
"or relationship is claimed to be true. This could be recorded automatically "
"when someone submits an online declaration form or be the submission date "
"listed on a physical form. For a service consolidating beneficial ownership "
"data, it would be the date on which several sources of information were "
"resolved to make a coherent claim about the state of an entity, person, or "
"relationship."

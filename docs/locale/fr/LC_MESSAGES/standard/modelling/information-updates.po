"Systems that collect and manage beneficial ownership information often "
"handle the updating or confirmation of existing records. Depending on how "
"the information is managed, the BODS data that is produced will offer a high"
" or low-resolution picture of the changing nature of a beneficial ownership "
"network. Data management systems handling information updates need to meet "
"the minimal set of requirements below, to offer a low-resolution picture."

Validating and verifying data
=============================

In order to be useful, the data that is published will need to be
validated. There are two areas of validation that can be planned for in
the producing data phase.

Validation against the standard

For interoperability with other publishers data, and to allow for common
data analysis tools, releases in JSON format should validate against the
version of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard schema used to produce
the data. Any serialisations to other formats should be tested to ensure
that the data is correctly represented.

For now, generic JSON schema validation tools should be used to test for
correctness. In the future, custom validation tools will be made
available to test the correctness of JSON outputs and serialisation to
flat file formats.

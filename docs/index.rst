Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (v0.4)
============================================

Information on who owns, controls, and benefits from companies and other corporate vehicles is an essential part of a well-functioning economy and society.

The Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS) is an open standard providing guidance for collecting, sharing and using high-quality data on beneficial ownership. 

This website contains the draft specification of version 0.4 of BODS plus support for its use. Documentation is available in `English <https://standard.openownership.org/en/latest/>`_, `French <https://standard.openownership.org/fr/latest/>`_, `Spanish <https://standard.openownership.org/es/latest/>`_ and `Russian <https://standard.openownership.org/ru/latest/>`_.

It is developed by `Open Ownership <https://www.openownership.org/>`_, a non-profit organisation focused on beneficial ownership transparency, in partnership with `Open Data Services <https://opendataservices.coop/>`_. Find out more about the :doc:`governance of BODS <../about/governance>` and how to get involved.
